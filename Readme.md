# NGINX Load Balancer Project

I have created a load balancing solution using NGINX to distribute traffic across multiple Node.js backend servers with SSL termination and reverse proxy capabilities.

## Overview

This project demonstrates implementing NGINX as a load balancer and reverse proxy for multiple Node.js servers running in Docker containers. It showcases essential web infrastructure concepts including load balancing, SSL termination, and reverse proxy configuration.

## Features

### Load Balancing
- Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers using least connection algorithm
- Improves application performance and reliability
- Automatic failover and redundancy

### SSL/TLS Support
- Secure HTTPS communication
- SSL termination at NGINX level
- Self-signed certificate implementation (configurable for production certificates)

### Reverse Proxy
- Single entry point for all client requests
- Enhanced security through backend server isolation
- Centralized access control and monitoring
- Response compression for improved performance

### Docker Integration
- Containerized Node.js backend servers
- Easy scaling and deployment
- Isolated environments for consistent behavior



## Architecture

```
Client Request → NGINX (Load Balancer) → Backend Servers
     ↑                    ↑
   HTTPS              SSL Termination
```

- NGINX front server handles SSL termination and load balancing
- Multiple Node.js backend servers process requests
- Docker containers provide isolation and easy scaling

## Key Components

### NGINX Configuration
- Worker processes for handling connections
- Upstream server definitions
- SSL certificate configuration
- Proxy settings and headers

### Load Balancer Settings
- Least connection algorithm implementation
- Backend server pool configuration
- Health checks and failure handling

### Security Features
- HTTPS enforcement
- Backend server isolation
- Header security configurations
- Access control implementation

## Performance Features

1. **Caching**
   - Backend response caching
   - Configurable cache duration
   - Cache bypass options

2. **Optimization**
   - Response compression
   - Chunked file transfers
   - Efficient connection handling

3. **Monitoring**
   - Centralized logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
